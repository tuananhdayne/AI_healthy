🩺 Vietnamese Health Consultation Chatbot

A Vietnamese health consultation chatbot built with intent classification + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide safe, guided, and non-diagnostic health advice.
The system focuses on intent routing, ambiguity handling, and controlled response generation rather than direct medical diagnosis.

📌 Key Features

🔍 Intent Classification (PhoBERT)
Classifies user queries into health-related intents (symptoms, nutrition, exercise, stress, others) to route the conversation correctly.

🧠 Top-2 Intent & Ambiguity Handling
Uses top-2 intent probabilities to detect ambiguous queries and trigger clarification (pending) instead of answering prematurely.

🔗 RAG Pipeline (SBERT + FAISS)
Retrieves relevant health knowledge passages before generating responses to reduce hallucination.

🤖 LLM-based Response Generation (Gemini)
Generates natural language responses grounded on retrieved context.

🛡️ Safety-Oriented Design

No diagnosis or prescription

Clarification for unclear inputs

Warning and recommendation to seek medical professionals in risky cases

👤 User Health Profile Management
Stores basic health information to personalize suggestions.

⏰ Medicine Reminder System
Allows users to create and manage medication reminders.
